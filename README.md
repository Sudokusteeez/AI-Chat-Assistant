# AI-Chat-Assistant
Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in AI and natural language processing. The chat assistant uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to understand and respond to user input, simulating a conversation with a sophisticated language model.

Key Features
AI Chat Interaction: Users can enter text input in the provided entry box, and the AI Chat Assistant responds with relevant information generated by GPT-3.5-turbo.

OpenAI Integration: The project utilizes OpenAI's API to communicate with the GPT-3.5-turbo model, showcasing the ability to integrate external AI services.

Conversation Log: The application logs the conversation history in the chat_log, demonstrating effective handling of conversation context.

Skills Demonstrated
Python Programming: The entire project is implemented in Python, showcasing proficiency in this versatile language.

Natural Language Processing: The integration of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo demonstrates knowledge and skills in natural language processing and using pre-trained language models.

User Interface (UI) Design: The project employs the tkinter library for a simple graphical user interface, demonstrating the ability to create interactive applications.

How to Use
Sign up for an OpenAI API key and set API_Key in the code to access the GPT-3.5-turbo model.

Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.

Clone the repository and navigate to the directory containing the Python script.

Run the application using the command:

Copy code
python chat_assistant.py
A window will open with the "ChatGPT" label, an input box, and a "Send" button.

Type your message in the input box and press "Send" to interact with the AI Chat Assistant.

Note
Please be aware that this is a simplified implementation and may not fully represent the capabilities of GPT-3.5-turbo. For production use, consider additional security measures and error handling.

Feel free to explore and modify the application to suit your needs and experiment with different AI models provided by OpenAI.
